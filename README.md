What if I told you that magic is real? What if I told you that wizards, witches, and everything from the world of Harry Potter is real, and they need you now?

In our fast-paced, modern world, they can't solve everything with spells and potions anymore. That's why now more than ever, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry needs a little bit of Muggle technology, to make the management of this enormous castle less of a headache. Of course, since witches and wizards have no idea about technology, you'll disguise your API as a set of more wizard-friendly spells, so that it's more intuitive for the target audience.

Let the techno... ahem, magic, begin!
